# Handwritten Digit Recognition
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 labeled training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.

## Project Structure

The project repository contains the following files:

- `hd.py`: The main Python script that includes the code for training the model and recognizing handwritten digits.
- `mnist_model.h5`: The trained model saved in HDF5 format.
- `README.md`: This file providing information about the project.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the code:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install the dependencies using the following command:

## Usage

To train the model and perform handwritten digit recognition, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:


2. Navigate to the project directory:


3. Run the `hd.py` script:


3. Run the `hd.py` script:


4. The script will prompt you to draw a digit. A separate window will open where you can use your mouse to draw a digit. Once you release the mouse button, the window will close, and the script will recognize the drawn digit.

## Results
After running the script, the predicted digit will be displayed in the console. This represents the model's recognition of the handwritten digit.

## Acknowledgments
The project is built upon the MNIST dataset and TensorFlow's deep learning framework. Thanks to the developers of these resources for providing the necessary tools and data for this project.
